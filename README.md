# Project: Recipes
This is a project where I'll be sharing some recipes for Salads and Cocktails. Why is that? Because I like to eat healthy food and like to enjoy tasteful drinks.

## About Salads
For me is difficult to get used to eating veggies in all my meals, so I'm trying to have variants in each dish. By doing this project I can find (in order to have at hand) some ideas when it's time to eat.

I'll be sharing my finds and some information about each one. Stuff like:
* Description
* Ingredients
* Preparation
* Nutritional Information

## About Cocktails
I'm a fan of having a good drink when I'm on a trip to the beach with friends or when having a birthday party. I like to have different options for drinking. I'll be sharing some cool drinks ideas to surprise your friends and guests. I'll be sharing:
* Description
* Ingredients
* Preparation

**Disclaimer**
* I do not advocate overconsumption or the abuse of alcohol. While I hope you will try the recipes and ideas I have on this site, I hope you will do so with responsibility. This content is not intended for promoting alcohol abuse, binge drinking, hazing, trolling, or any other forms of abuse.
* Don’t drink if you’re not of legal age and before you’re 25. Give your brain time to develop before you drink alcohol. You’ll have developed stronger decision-making skills and save yourself from some hard lessons.
* Never drink and drive. Take a Lyft or other rideshare service home if you’re out and planning on drinking. Call your mom if you need. She’s probably up and would like to hear from you anyway.
* Drinking excessively will cause harm to your body and mind. Please drink mindfully. Seek help from a professional if you have a problem, or if you think you might have one.
